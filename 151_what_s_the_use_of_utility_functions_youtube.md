# What is a utility function?


<a id="orgb4de7ab"></a>

## World states

Utility functions arrange utilities and preferences of agents.
You can give world states numbers and in AI you have to.

### Preferences

1.  Completeness

    A &sc; B
    A &sc; B
    A ~ B

2.  Transitivity

    Intransitive

### Preferences with these properties are said to be consistent

Utility functions assume there are coherent goal directed behavior. Its actually a minimal assumption

# Personal Summary

Utility functions are a simplified assumption of an intelligent agent&rsquo;s ordered preference of world states.
Humans may have inconsistent behavior, but that is not the mark of an optimized intelligence.
The assumption of a utility function is valid.
