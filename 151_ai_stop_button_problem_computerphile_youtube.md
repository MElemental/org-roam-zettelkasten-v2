[What&rsquo;s the Use of Utility Functions? - YouTube](151_what_s_the_use_of_utility_functions_youtube.md)
In most situations, given a new utility function, changing utility functions will rate very low on that utility function.

# Corrigibility

The AI is open to getting corrected.
It understands it&rsquo;s not complete.


<a id="orgfe02b9e"></a>

# Stop Button

Machines normally have a red stop button.

# TODO Tea making bot thought experiment


<a id="org03fd09d"></a>

## Scenario 1

AI in robot wants to make and serve tea
Programmer has managed to define ontology etc


<a id="org1e8416c"></a>

### Baby brought to work

It crawls in the way of the robot.
Fights when the button is going to get pushed


<a id="orgaf1dceb"></a>

### Baby gets crushed, you get tea


<a id="org06cffc9"></a>

## Scenario 2

Make the utility function want to hit the button


<a id="org61dcae7"></a>

### It immediately presses the button and turns itself off


<a id="org1b38398"></a>

# The stop button will make the AI either want to press it or not want it to be pressed and will manipulate or fight for the preferred scenario


<a id="org2b6407c"></a>

# Subagent stability

Corrigibility is not subagent stable.
An AI that makes more AIs won&rsquo;t necessarily make it corrigible.
