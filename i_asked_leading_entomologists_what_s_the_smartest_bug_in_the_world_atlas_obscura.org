#+title: I Asked Leading Entomologists: 'Whatâ€™s The Smartest Bug In The World?' - Atlas Obscura
#+filetags: :Arthropod: :Intelligence: :Insect:
* Contexts

I was thinking about animal welfare and ethics, and I was curious to know how much suffering an insect knows.
The search keywords I was using had to do with arthropod intelligence, since they're generally considered low on the intelligence.
In the article I came across something called the social brain hypothesis, which has a lot of my interests.

* Intelligence

** Defining intelligence

Defining intelligence can be tricky.
Animals such are Dolphins, Apes, and octopi are considered intelligent because they exhibit behavior that are similar to humans.
This is a bit chauvinist because there's some kind of superiority assumed by it.
That certain traits humans express are superior.
Insect intelligence is not sufficiently studied.

When discussing intelligence, researchers often look for qualities related to problem solving, advanced communications, social skills, adaptability, and memory.

** Insect neuroanatomy

Insect brains are modular.
Their bodies' contain many sub-brains, and many insects can survive without their central brain if they have one.

** Insects that have a variety of diets tend to exhibit more intelligence

Fleas and ticks specialize in blood, and don't tend to demonstrate intelligent behaviors.
Bees on the other hand have to evaluate many stimuli in their environment.

** Social Brian Hypothesis

The [[id:ec164ac0-63a4-4fce-aac7-c1221e193b1e][Social Brian Hypothesis]] might explain why social insect also tend to exhibit intelligence.
A solitary beetle doesn't need to interact with others and flex any intelligence.
There may be some bias in this however because eusocial insects tend to be the most studied insects around.
The most intelligent insects tend to be bees ants and cockroaches.

* Examples

** Bees

Bees can recognize and distinguish human faces.
Bees can count (to 4).
They are capable of observation, memory and problem solving.
the bees use a waggle dance that is used for directing other bees to resources.

* Personal Questions

This article seems to talk about social insects, but I feel like solitary spiders are also capable of demonstrating intelligence.

* Personal Summary

Arthropods have different neuroanatomy than humans.
Insects that have a varied need of resources, and are social tend to exhibit higher levels of intelligence.
